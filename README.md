## Background and Purpose Statement
Having many people pressing the bottle of hand sanitizer by hand, it could put potential danger in virus contamination, especially in public places like shops, or even at home.I want to have a device that could turn a normal hand sanitizer to a contactless automatic hand sanitizer.

Make the hand sanitizer bottle bought from supermarket to be contactless and automatic hand sanitizer that triggers when hands approach the bottle.

## Schema
The project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the approach of user's hands to activate the servo motor. This servo will then press the plunger of the handwash bottle thus dispensing the soap.

## Bill of Materials:

1.Servo motor: MG995 High Speed Digital 12kg Metal Gear Servo

2.Arduino UNO Board

3.Ultrasonic Sensor

4.Breadboard

5.Wires

6.Copper

7.Hot Glue Gun

## Instructions
